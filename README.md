This is my first serious app project using React so I'm not making any guarantees about the quality of this project, and the development will be slow.

# Riichi Mahjong Personal Score Tracker

Use this app on your phone or whatever to track your personal points in a game of Riichi Mahjong.

Riichi Mahjong has a fairly complicated scoring system and a fairly unconvenient score tracking method, i.e. scoring sticks. All the time, you have to ask someone to give you ten 100-point sticks for one 1000-point stick so you can pay 700 points to another player, and stuff like that.

I love the game but I hate the scoring sticks.

So I'm now building this app where you can just quickly, with the press of a few buttons, keep track of your personal score. It'll show you a pad of all the different possible score transactions, and you just choose what happens when something happens, and it'll show you your score.

If everyone uses this app to keep track of their own score, no scoring sticks will be necessary.

## The rest is the default readme file.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
